# LMaps #

An Android mobile maps application designed for privacy and self-sufficiency

## Vision ##

LMaps is intended to be a mobile mapping application that:
* Minimizes the sharing of the user's activity with other organizations
* Works worldwide and without an Internet connection
  * (Some advanced features may require Internet access)

## Technology ##

To achieve its goals, LMaps will use [Mapsforge](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge) to render map data from the [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) project. All map data will be stored locally on the device.

## Roadmap ##

### Phase 1 ###

Phase 1 provides the application's core functionality. At the completion of phase 1, the application should be able to:

* Display maps of any location in the world without connecting to the Internet
* Show the user's location on the map

### Later phases ###

Additional features to be added later include:

* Address and location lookup
* Driving directions with turn-by-turn navigation
* Public transit navigation
* Real-time public transit status information, where available
